# How will you choose the best technology to develop your scalable mobile app backend between NodeJS vs Python vs Java? Share a detailed answer with a unique point of view.

I will choose NodeJS as the backend language for developing scalable mobile app backend. 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment to run web applications outside the clientâ€™s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.
NodeJS is very easy to learn and very flexible and uses syntax of Javascript.
NodeJS is single threaded and asynchronous event driven model which goes very well for scalable backend development for read write operations and it is faster then Python and Java, it offers non blocking I/O API.
It also offers many frameworks which makes it alot easier to write backend code with simplified syntax, Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and IoT application.

# Share your thoughts on the future of Blockchain technology and its application.

Blockchain is a database of information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change or hack. 
Blockchain is easy for transaction as it is encrypted with complex algorithms using cryptography which is safe and cannot get hacked by the hacker. As the generation is evolving the technology is evolving too and the first and foremost things comes to mind is secuity as everthing is going digital that is where blockchain comes handy as the technology evolving day by day we need more securities for our datas and blockchain helps solving this problem with complex algorithms used for hashing and encrypting datas and making it more secure from the hackers to breach. 
Blockchain offers securities , all participants has a copy of ledger , the identity of the participants remains anonymous , it is immutable , a transaction timestamp is recorded in a block and is encrypted.
